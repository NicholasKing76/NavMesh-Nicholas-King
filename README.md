 Assignment 6

1. In scene 1, I used the rocks in the Nature Starter Kit to use as obstacles and collectibles. I also added a way to keep score.

2. In scene 2, I added moving obstacles and objects to collect, as well as a way to keep score.

3. In scene 3, the objects now load in random spots when the scene is loaded, this includes one rock that will increase your score.

4. In scene 4, I made two planes and a bridge between them that only the player can cross. There is an enemy that chases the player
   and a score that goes up if the player is caught. Another score goes up if the player crosses the bridge.
   
5. In scene 5, I replaced the character model that I have been using with the secretary model. This model also animates.
